## Getting Started
You can find installation instructions in the [docs](https://swirl-lang.vercel.app/docs/getting-started/installation).

Once you have Swirl installed, simply open a terminal and create a file named hello.sw with a simple hello world program: 
```
print("Hello World")
```

To run the program, save your code and use the swirl compiler to compile and run the program.
```bash
swirl hello.sw --run
```
Here the --run flag compiles and runs the program in a single command.
